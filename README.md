# Puzzlr-Backend

This is the backend/REST API for the Puzzlr iOS/Android application me, [Gaurav Sheni](https://github.com/gsheni), Teddy Beachley, and Brad Naumann built for our CSC331 Software Engineering class at WFU. 

It uses a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) and currently runs on Heroku.
