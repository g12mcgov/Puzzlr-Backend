# Puzzlr-Backend

This is the backend/REST API for the Puzzlr iOS/Android application me, [Gaurav Sheni](https://github.com/gsheni), Teddy Beachley, and Brad Naumann built for our CSC331 Software Engineering class at WFU. 

It uses a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) and currently runs on Heroku.


Setup:
=======

You must first have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Once you've installed node and npm, clone the project, and in the root directory, run the following:

`npm install`

This will install the required npm modules. Next, run the following to start the express server:

`npm start`

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the running web instance.
